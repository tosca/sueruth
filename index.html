            <p>Things that influenced me: <br><br>
                When I was in elementary school my friend RuthEllen and I , would walk to Cobbs Hill Park and climb
                the hiking trails up the hill. We would collect rocks that glittered, which we thought were diamonds.
                We would take them home and wash them, and enjoy the beauty of each rock. This was one of my
                first recollection of loving stones.

           <p>I was always close to my Aunt Ann {my mom’s sister}, and my cousin Debby. My aunt had lots of
            jewelry, and she would show me some of her beautiful rings,etc. Some of the pieces were expensive
            traditional jewelry, but others were interesting pieces she found on her travels around the world. I
            would think about her jewelry ….not realizing , at the time, that it would influence me.

                <p>On another note, dance in my childhood through adulthood, influenced me. I started taking dance
                    lessons at about the age of 8, and continued until I was 40 at which time I injured my knee, and had to
                    stop dancing. I love the long lines and angles that the body creates while moving or posing. I have
                    always gone to the theatre to watch various ballet companies perform.</p>
                </p> Another influence is architecture. When visiting someone’s home or a building, or museum, I always
                    look up at the angles that form all around me…and slowly follow those angles down and around the
                    building.

                <h1>Artist Statement</h1> 
                <p>I’m interested in form, texture, and surface design. I’m inspired looking at forms
                    in nature ( mountains, sky, ocean), architecture ( lines, angles, and shadows ), and 
                    body movement (the body moving in space when dancing, running, stretching ).
                    I work primarily in silver, using stones, enamels, and pigment for accents of color.
                    Each piece is hand fabricated. I’m more interested in the process than the
                    finished product - in what happens along the way. Often what I start with is not
                    what I end up with. Something might happen in the process that I find interesting
                    and that moves me in another direction.
                </p>
                <p>As the piece is evolving, instead of thinking about what more is needed for the
                    piece to work, I think more about what isn’t needed in the piece…what can I take
                    away. Less is best.
                </p>
                <p>I’ve loved teaching my entire adult life. It could be teaching a child how to work
                    with clay, or teaching an adult how to solder. I love it when a student gets so
                    excited about learning something new, and I love watching what they do with
                    that knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps because my degree is in counseling, I want students to feel good 
                    about themselves and what they’re doing, as they proceed in the process of learning and growing.
